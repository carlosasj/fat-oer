In general, FAT maps the disk's partitions using two concepts: 

	The first one is cluster, which reffers to the size of the disk's blocks. In this system, just multiples of 512 KB are used.
	The second one is a table that remains in the main memory and have one entry for each disk's block existent in the partition. Which entry is made by 32 bytes that storage the name of the file, control bits, metadata and the disk's block location that reffers to the beggining of the file. The system works like a linked list. Each block has its share of data of a file and a pointer to the next block (reffered to the same file). The pointer points to "end of file" when the file has ended or indicates that the file was corrupted, providing in this situation more information about the issue.

FAT-12

	This FAT's version has 12 bits to map each partition in the allocation table. Each disk's block has a default size of 512 bytes. Therefore, it has the maximum of 4096 entries, each one with 2 bytes in the FAT. When the disks had been launched, Microsoft allowed the usage of blocks with 1 KB, 2 KB and 4 KB. With that, the partition's size grew up to 16 MB. Because MS-DOS supports up to 4 partitions in a disk, the disk's total capacity ends up being 64 MB.

FAT-16

	This FAT's version has 16 bits to map each partition in the allocation table and the support to blocks with 8 KB, 16 KB and 32 KB was added. The maximum size that this FAT has is 2 GB (2^16 * 32 KB), therefore, the disk has up to 4 partitions of 2 GB, or 8 GB total.

FAT-32

	This FAT's version has 28 bits to map each partition in the allocation table. The maximum size of the table is 2 TB (2^28 * 32 KB) for each partition, allowing a disk up to 8 TB (4 partitions of 2 TB each).
