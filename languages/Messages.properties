fat12_supporting_text=\	This FAT's version has 12 bits to map each partition in the allocation table. Each disk's block has a default size of 512 bytes. Therefore, it has the maximum of 4096 entries, each one with 2 bytes in the FAT. When the disks had been launched, Microsoft allowed the usage of blocks with 1 KB, 2 KB and 4 KB. With that, the partition's size grew up to 16 MB. Because MS-DOS supports up to 4 partitions in a disk, the disk's total capacity ends up being 64 MB.\
