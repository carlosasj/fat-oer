fat-table-header = FAT Table
fat12_supporting_text = This FAT's version has 12 bits to map each partition in the allocation table. Each disk's block has a default size of 512 bytes. Therefore, it has the maximum of 4096 entries, each one with 2 bytes in the FAT. When the disks had been launched, Microsoft allowed the usage of blocks with 1 KB, 2 KB and 4 KB. With that, the partition's size grew up to 16 MB. Because MS-DOS supports up to 4 partitions in a disk, the disk's total capacity ends up being 64 MB.
fat16_supporting_text = This FAT's version has 16 bits to map each partition in the allocation table and the support to blocks with 8 KB, 16 KB and 32 KB was added. The maximum size that this FAT has is 2 GB (2^16 * 32 KB), therefore, the disk has up to 4 partitions of 2 GB, or 8 GB total.
fat32_supporting_text = This FAT's version has 28 bits to map each partition in the allocation table. The maximum size of the table is 2 TB (2^28 * 32 KB) for each partition, allowing a disk up to 8 TB (4 partitions of 2 TB each).
