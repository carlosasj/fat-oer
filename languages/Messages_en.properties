fat12_supporting_text = This FAT's version has 12 bits to map each partition in the allocation table. Each disk's block has a default size of 512 bytes. Therefore, it has the maximum of 4096 entries, each one with 2 bytes in the FAT. When the disks had been launched, Microsoft allowed the usage of blocks with 1 KB, 2 KB and 4 KB. With that, the partition's size grew up to 16 MB. Because MS-DOS supports up to 4 partitions in a disk, the disk's total capacity ends up being 64 MB.
fat16_supporting_text = This FAT's version has 16 bits to map each partition in the allocation table and the support to blocks with 8 KB, 16 KB and 32 KB was added. The maximum size that this FAT has is 2 GB (2^16 * 32 KB), therefore, the disk has up to 4 partitions of 2 GB, or 8 GB total.
fat32_supporting_text = This FAT's version has 28 bits to map each partition in the allocation table. The maximum size of the table is 2 TB (2^28 * 32 KB) for each partition, allowing a disk up to 8 TB (4 partitions of 2 TB each).

fat-description = The FAT Simulator's objective is to work as a tool for learning the FAT File System. This Open Eduational Resource (OER) contains small texts about FAT 12, FAT 16 and FAT 32. It's intuitive and easy to use in the classroom by professors and students and its content helps the student make a solid and clear understanding of the subject. To deliver all of that, the simulator is made by a interactive light interface, with controllers and responsive colorful tables.
brief-description = Brief description
max-disk-sixe = Max Disk Size
disk-size-invalid = Disc size invalid!
manual = At the top of the website, we find anchor buttons (A) which takes us to the types of FAT's descriptions and characteristics and comparisons as well. We can also find options for language changing (B), “How to Use” and display the OER's“Authors” (D). For each kind of FAT, there is a short text with its main characteristics. In the beggining of the website, to begin a simmulation, you should insert the number of blocks and its size (of each one). After these choices, “Apply Changes”. Then, the card will rotate, showing the representation of the File Table (1), FAT (2) and the disk's blocks (3).The last thing you should do is insert the amount of files as you want, each one with its size and name. These will be organized according to the insertions or remotions made. According as the insertions and/or remotions are made, the components (1, 2 and 3) simultaneous updates are notable. For a better visualization, the elements of all the components are highlighted as the user puts the mouse over one of them.

compare_supporting_text = After some simulations using this OER and with the table, two things are noticeable:\n\
  1. The evolution of the FAT System kept up with the storage devices's scalability.\n\
2. Nowadays we have high storage capacities and FAT isn't often used because of the high RAM usage. However, there are exceptions like pendrives and mobile devices, that have low storage capacities.
